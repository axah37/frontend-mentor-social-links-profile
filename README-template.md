## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This project was very similar to the last challenge, blog post preview. I used the same techniques. While I didn't learn anything new, I did have a chance to practice those skills. 

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my code organizations, and try to have a more modular layout from the start. I feel like I spent a lot of time fussing with the layout to align the text when I could have just wraped my content and handled alignment in one place.
